Hello PICO-8

1. Create a GIF of you loading any game from the PICO-8 carts website.

2. Create a GIF of you pasting code from an existing PICO-8 game (perhaps from the Lexaloffle BBS) into the programming interface and running it. Remember that you can access the source code by entering the editor with the ESC key. Note that this will require you to find a game that runs without using sprites (This means it does not have anything in the sprite screen but what is there by default. See below.).

3. Create a GIF of you typing the code:
print('hello <your name>')

5. Take a screenshot of the PICO-8 folder that contains your .p8 files (take a look at the File System part of the Manual, linked above, if you need help with this; note that I've changed my configuration to put it in a non-standard location!).
